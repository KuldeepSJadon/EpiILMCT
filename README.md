[![CRAN_Status_Badge](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/EpiILMCT)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=EpiILMCT)
[![Downloads](https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/EpiILMCT)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=EpiILMCT)

The R package *EpiILMCT* provides tools for simulating from continuous-time individual level models of disease transmission, and carrying out infectious disease data analyses with the same models. The epidemic models considered are distance-based and contact network-based models within Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) or Susceptible-Infectious-Notified-Removed (SINR) compartmental frameworks.
